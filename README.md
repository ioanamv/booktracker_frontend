# Book Tracker Mobile App

A mobile app to manage personal reading list. Users can log in, add books with title, author, reading status (**To Read**, **In Progress**, **Completed**), completion date, and a 1â€“5 star rating.

Authentication is handled via **Firebase**, with a **Flutter frontend** and a **Spring Boot backend** using **PostgreSQL**.

## Frontend
This is the mobile client built with Flutter. It handles user authentication, communicates with the backend API, and provides a clean interface to manage the reading list, track progress, and rate books.
